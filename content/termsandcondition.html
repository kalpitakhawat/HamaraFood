<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. Any order that you place with us is subject to product availability, delivery capacity and acceptance by us and the Participating Restaurant. When you place your order online, we will send you an email to confirm that we have received it. This email confirmation will be produced automatically so that you have confirmation of your order details. You must inform us immediately if any details are incorrect.

Once we have sent the confirmation email we will check availability and delivery capacity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
